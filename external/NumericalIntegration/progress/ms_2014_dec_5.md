# Unit Test Updates - IntegratorTest.cpp, Pow and Oscillate tests

I broke out the tests from IntegratorTest.cpp to imitate the existing structure of the Sine, LogPow, and Peak test files and unify the unit tests into a single style.  The Peak test in IntegratorTest.cpp was made redundant by the testIntegrator_Peak.cpp test which Sree created, so it was simply deleted.  The remaining functional tests, Pow and Oscillate were broken out into separate test files, testIntegrator_Pow.cpp and testIntegrator_Oscillate.cpp.

## Discussion 

The two "new" tests, testIntegrator_Pow.cpp and testIntegrator_Oscillate.cpp are not yet complete, they are lacking expected test values of appropriate precision.  A decision should be made about whether the tests add value or are redundant before additional time is spent in correcting the expected test values.

The Pow test is a subset of the LogPow test, (slightly simpler but perhaps still of value), and the Oscillate test is a superset of the Sine test, (slightly more complex and thus perhaps of value).

This work also leaves no contents in the file IntegratorTest.cpp, so that file could be repurposed as a master test function insertion point to call all tests, or we can simply delete it.

## Next steps

Please comment back as to whether we should spend additional time to complete the calculation of the closed form of the expected values for the additional tests or simply drop the additional tests.

If these tests are worth keeping, we will need to complete the expected value calculations and double check the tests for errors before finalizing.

We also need to decide what to do with IntegratorTest.cpp.  Please advise.
