# Sine, LogPow, and Peak Test Progress!!

I was able to carry out sensitivity analysis on roundoff variables in the Integrator.h code base ported directly from QUADPAK and found efectively no changes in the output results of any of the tests when altering roundoff values or other variables within Integrator.h.  I was, however, able to discover that the Kronrod Node/Weight and Gauss Weight values have significant impact on overall results, to the point that the computation of the nodes/weights to appropriate digits allows tests to pass/fail in cases when the nodes/weights are calculated to less/more than the precision required from the test.

This was the most singularly significant progress I have been able to achieve in the past 8 weeks and am relieved to have learned of the corrolation between precision of the calculated nodes/weights and the capability of the integration tests to pass.

## Discussion 
The current nodePrecision branch of the repository has values that pass for each of the tests, Sine, LogPow, and Peak. The LogPow test is perhaps the most revealing, as it fails at setprecision(256) when the tabulated node/weight values are recorded at 114 digits.  The recorded values at 256 digits were calculated at setprecision(512) out of convenience and could be investigated further as the likely result is that they simply require a few digits greater precision in calculation over what is stored to file.

The Sine test fails at 117 digits of precision.  The reason we should expect failure somewhere beyond approximately 78 digits is that is the value we begin seeing divergence across the origin in the values calculated for the kronrod/gauss nodes/weights.  More work will be required to remedy the sine test on two accounts: 1) the sine function requires overloading just as the pow() function does in order to be properly calculated beyond quad precision, and 2) this is the level of precision we are currently able to precisely calculate the Kronrod nodes/weights and achieve symmetry between negative and positive values.  Because of the proven sensitivity of the precision of the nodes/weights and the ability to solve at high precision, we should expect to see failures beyond the level we are able to compute symmetric solutions for nodes and weights using the Laurie/Gautschi method.

Additional investigation could be made to determine if the Piessens' values can achieve better results than the Laurie/Gautschi results at high precision as a result of library dependencies and the EigenSolver() function being utilized in the Eigen Library which may be the bottleneck at quad precision.

We can take a few different approaches at this point armed with the new knowlege we have: 1) We can tackle the overloading of the pow() and sine() functions with Pavel given the inherent requirements of mpreal.h and the multiprecision library to be able to handle usage such as we have pursued. or 2) we can move ahead with finishing what we have and moving toward a pull request even given the shortcomings in Sine, LogPow and Peak function tests.

The issue with the Sine test is the sine function itself, which will require more work to overcome just as we already require with pow() and gamma() in NIHeaders.h.

The issue with the Peak test is that it passes only with low alpha values and fails with higher alpha values.  The greater the rule number (number of nodes/weights) the higher the alpha value can typically be raised and still pass, however this is only a correlation and not a hard rule. The non-linear nature of the adaptive algorithm as expressed in QUADPACK's documentation and the bound volume both express this likely occurrence and the documentation speaks for itself about when a function is ill suited for a particular function to integrate.  The remaining result is likely to be that for functions such as the Peak test exhibit, a different integrator may ultimately be neccessary.

## Next steps

Everything we have bodes well for polishing what we have and presenting it to Eigen for a pull request, I believe.

We need to speak with Pavel about what we know now and about how we interact with mpreal for the pow() and sine() function overloads in mpreal types.

I feel that we can also do better with a generic function for the calculation of the nodes/weights, which I have framed into the QuadratureKronrod.h contents, however it will require a more skilled hand than I to either make it work or to tell me that this functionality cannot be achieved in header files as I have envisioned.

Outside of the pow(), sine(), and generic node/weight calculation, I feel we may be essentially ready to present a new pull request to Eigen... very exciting progress!
