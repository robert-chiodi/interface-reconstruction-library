## Collapsed the code base to reduce multiple implementations the best of each only.`

The following files were removed, leaving their better duplicate counterparts in place for the remainder of the work:
    1. Integrator.h -> Integrator.hpp
    2. IntegratorDefinitions.h -> Integrator.hpp
    3. kronrodLaurieGautschi_MS.hpp -> removed in favor of leaving STB implementation in permanence.
    4. outputPiessens.cpp -> removed, no longer required for calculated values testing - all testing completed.
    5. PiessensOriginalFortranCode.f -> Fortran no longer needed, C++ code reproducing results exactly.
    6. QuadratureKronrod.h -> QuadratureKronrod.hpp

## Node weight calculation resides in `nodes_weights/kronrodLaurieGautschi.hpp` and `nodes_weights/kronrodPiessens.hpp`

    1. The Laurie Gautschi implementation is STB's work ported from original matlab, the Piessens' implementation is MS's and MB's work ported from original Fortran77 code.  Laurie/Gautschi utilizes what is also known as the Golub-Welsch algorithm from 1968, and Piessens' employs what is understood commonly as Patterson's implementation also from 1968.

## Quadrature takes place in `quadrature/Integrator.hpp` which calls static hardcoded node/weight values from `quadrature/QuadratureKronrod.hpp`

QuadratureKronrod.hpp currently contains values for rules beyond N=30, which is 61 Kronrod nodes.  Additional values can be removed by anyone who feels strongly that they are uneccessary moving forward.

    1. QuadratureKronrod.hpp carries out array assignments for calculated values and contains the 'ComputeNodesAndWeights()' function call.

## changes to `test/` directory

    1. Unneccessary tests are removed.

    2. The test file 'testLaurieGauthsci.cpp' should probably be renamed to reflect its' current use to evaluate Piessens' output against Laurie/Gautschi's method.  This file is the only instance of evaluating different methods for node calculations against each other, so it could be refactored/improved in the future to be used as a unit test for comparisons between existing and newly added node calculations.

    3. Tests implemented by STB for Sine, LogPow, and Peak remain and will be added to.  A well strucutred approach to the addition of a greater number of tests is being attended to by STB as well as additional test creation. 

## Issues

1. We need to refactor a minor difference we have in the code base where the names 'Kronrod', 'Kronrad', and 'Konrad' all exist.  I ran the original Russian spelling of A.S. Kronrod's name through a couple of online translators recently and always came back with "Kronrod", so I believe that this is appropriate English spelling of his name.  Minor refactoring will align all of the code in this detail and should be simple.  Please let the group know if you are aware of other important reasons I am not taking into consideration at present.

2. Merge to Master Branch - Sree, once you are happy with everything, please let us know by merging what you want to Master!

3. The pow() function issue remains.  

4. I think it might be a good time to work toward removing NIHeaders to reduce file count and further condense the code base in preparation for Eigen submission.


## Congratulations on pulling the Code Base along to this State!

Thanks for getting everything this far Gentlemen!  Things are in a great state as they stand.  Looking back to the original pull request submitted to Eigen, the only detail remaining unattended to is a simple example of how to use the code.  

(On that note, Sree, could I ask your help with creating a really small example?  you might have the best insight at present in what it's like to grab the integration code and try to interact with it from the outside.)

Congratulations once again and thanks for all of your efforts!
