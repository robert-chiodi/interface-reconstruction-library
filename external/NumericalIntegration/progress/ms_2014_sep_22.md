# comparison of STB's and MS's code for Laurie-Gautschi and Piessens method... continued

I was able to carry out comparisons for even-valued rule sets and carefully observe the differences in the calculated results.  The effort yeilded some fascinating results as well as one detail I neglected to observe previously.

Using mpreal(256), I compared the results of rules of N = 10, 20, and 30 to the corresponding Fullerton values. Interestingly, the results of today's testing indicate that I have previously neglected to test our code with odd valued rule functions and the result of requesting N = 7, 15, or 25 result in the MS Laurie code calculating NaN values and the STB Laurie code segfaulting and dumping the memory core.  

Given our Laurie code shortcomings, I restricted the remaining Laurie tests to even valued numbers but did compare Piessens' calculations for odd numbered rules N = 7, 15, and 25.

Additionally, I checked the online Kiesan calculator which relies on Pavel Holodbordko's code. I only then noticed that that code accepts only odd numbered inputs, (which appears to be our even numbered rules plus one value at the origin, in case this yeilds any additional insights, http://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1289382036).

## Discussion 

The Laurie method calculations match the Fullerton nodes and weights calculations perfectly when roundeed to the same decimal place for all nodes and weights.

At rules of value N <= 10, the Piessens' method calculations match all of the Fullerton node values except for the largest (outermost) node. All node values except for the largest node match the Fullerton values.  The largets node alone does not match until the 31st decimal place for N = 7, then as the rule number increases to N = 10 and n = 15 the Piessen's method accuracy grows to match the Fullerton values at the 33rd and 34th decimal places, respectively.

Interestingly, however, while the Piessen's method nodes do match the Fullteron values to the 35th decimal for values of N = 20, 25, and 30, both the Piessen's Kronrod and Gauss weights differ significantly from Fullerton's... in fact, there is disagreement between the Piessen's and Fullerton's calculated weights for all rules at values beyond the 16th decimal place,... just out of the reach of double precision!

This seems to give convincing evidence of one of two events, either that there remains a mistake in the MS Piessen's code, or that Fullerton did not use the Piessens' method when he calculated the values in 1981 at Bell Labs.  The occurrence of a mistake in the MS Piessens' nodes calculations seems unlikely due to the agreement at higher rule numbers, so an explanation would need to be in order at least for the node discrepancies.  The weight discrepancies could still somehow be the result of a mistake in the code, although it seems unlikely due to the ease of comparison against the original fortran.

This also bodes well for some interesting results when comparing the use of the two nodes/weights calculations against the closed-form solutions unit tests of the quadrature routines!  The results should be different enough from each other to yeild interesting evidence of the validity of one approach over the other from a precision standpoint, and the computational stability may remain to be seen.

Furthermore, we have proven the Piessen's code to match the Fullerton code better at double precision, so there might still be room for both appraoches given the need for ultimate precision vs computational speed or the size of the executable code files.

## Next steps

We will want to address the issues in our code which cause odd numbered rules to not produce results or to crash the program.  We should also modify the Laurie codes to output the Gauss weights for comparison against the Fullerton values.
