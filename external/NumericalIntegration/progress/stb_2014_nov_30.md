# Comparing the Laurie and Piessens codes

My aim is to check the nodes and weights produced by Laurie and Piessens codes.

## Making a uniform interface

First step is to make a uniform interface with which both method can be called.
I changed Mark's Piessens code into a class so that it can be called as
a policy. The code can be found in `nodes_weights/kronrodPiessensClass.h`.

I added a method `computeAbscissaeAndWeights` to both Laurie and
Piessens classes.

        static void computeAbscissaeAndWeights(unsigned int nNodes,
            Eigen::Array<RealType, Eigen::Dynamic, 1> &abscGaussKronrod,
            Eigen::Array<RealType, Eigen::Dynamic, 1> &weightGaussKronrod,
            Eigen::Array<RealType, Eigen::Dynamic, 1> &weightGauss)


## Testing the precision of nodes and weights

I test the precision of nodes and weights computed by both codes.

### Check for precision

I compute the nodes and weights for `N=100` rule with `mpfr` precision `256`. I
find that both codes agree up to `67` digits.

### Check for consistency

Now I check how consistent the numbers are for different precision for the same
code. I test the codes with `N=100` rule for two different precisions
`256,320,384` and `448`.We check up to how many digits they agree.
I find that the Laurie code agrees with each other up to 90 digits for `384`
and `448`. They agree up to 80 digits between `320` and `384`.

The Piessens code returns an error at `320,384,448` which says
`Newton-Raphson iterative abscissae solver failed`. We need to investigate this
further. I tried to increase the number of iterations but didn't solve the
problem. I printed out the `delta` values of the Newton's method and found that
they show an oscillatory behavior. We may be able to solve this by changing the
start point of the iterations.
