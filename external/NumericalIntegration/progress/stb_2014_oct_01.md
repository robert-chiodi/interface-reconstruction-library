## in the directory `quadrature`

    1. Integrator.h -> Integrator.hpp
    2. IntegratorDefinitions.h -> IntegratorDefinitions.hpp

These changes are only for the correct syntax highlighting. I am happy to change
it back to *.h if you guys don't agree.

## Issues

1. I have changed the structure of the `Integrator.h` significantly. The modified
file is called `Integrator.hpp`. This is the only header needed now.
We can definitely separate this into two files if need. This is the reason why I
kept the old files `Integrator.h` and `IntegratorDefinitions.h`.

2. On the fly computing of nodes and weights is done in line 62. The computing
is only done once. I have now discovered that this may be an issue for mpreal if
someone changes the precision in the middle. I probably need a check for this as well.
You can switch this feature off by uncommenting the line and all the values will be
initialized with default values `QuadratureKronrod_STB.hpp`.

3. See the test `tests/testIntegrator_Sine.cpp` . A very simple function.
It integrates sin(x) in the interval (0,pi). The answer is 2. See more details
[here](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+sin%28+x%29+from+x%3D0+to+pi )

4. This test now works `Sclar=float` or `Scalar=double` and we are using the default
values for the nodes and weights (in other words no on the fly computation).
`long double` does not pass the test. We need to understand this behavior.

5. When I switch on the on the fly. Things are worse! I get an assertion error
in some cases. The reason for this seems to be coming from `QuadratureKronrod::ComputeNodesAndWeights()`
I wrote a test function for this. See `tests/testQuadratureKronrad.cpp`. If you
run this executable (compiled with Sclar=float) several times you can see that
some times it throws up crazy values! This need to be properly understood.

6. Let's now switch off the on the fly computation. If this case there are some
other issues in `quadrature/Integrator.hpp`. One issue is regarding the input
`desiredRelativeError` in the function `quadratureAdaptive`. See the lines 91-97.
How do we choose 5e-28? If I use mpreal with precision 128 we will always get m_errorCode = 6;
I use the same functions for computing desiredRelativeError ie `Eigen::NumTraits<Scalar>::epsilon() * Scalar(50.)`
In other words Scalar(5.e-28) will always be bigger.


    if ((desiredAbsoluteError <= 0.
         && desiredRelativeError < (std::max)(Eigen::NumTraits<Scalar>::epsilon() * Scalar(50.), Scalar(5.e-28) ))
        || m_maxSubintervals < 1)
    {
      m_errorCode = 6;
      return 0.;
    }



7. I have created some custom maths functions insude `NIHeaders.hpp`. I need them for templating.

8. There is an issue of using pow() function inside Eigen. It complains about no matching
function available.

9. In the file `quadrature/IntegratorTest.cpp` or `quadrature/IntegratorTest_STB.cpp`, we are
using `abs()` for getting the absolute value. It should be `std::abs()` for `fabs()`. This is the
reason why the test passes. If we change to `std::abs()` The peak test will definitely fail. These files
are compiled with the original header files `Integrator.h`,`IntegratorDefinitions.h` and `QuadratureKronrod.h`.
