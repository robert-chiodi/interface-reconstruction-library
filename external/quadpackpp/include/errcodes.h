 \brief Error handling

 Adaptive quadrature routine(s) in quadpack++ throw an exception when a
 numerical difficulty is encountered. For continuity with the original QUADPACK
 routnes and their GSL implemenation, an integer error code is also returned.
 Usage might be along the lines
 \code
 int errcode;
 try {
    errcode = Work.qag(f, a, b, epsabs, epsrel, limit, &result, &abserr);
 }
 catch (const char* reason) {
    std::cerr << reason << std::endl;
    ...
 }
 \endcode
 The table of error codes from the GSL is used here without modification.
